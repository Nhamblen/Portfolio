      <p>My dream is to be a Physical Therapistâ€™s Assistant (PTA). PTAs help people to gain range of motion, help with
        balance, and restore gait functionality alongside the Physical Therapist (PT). I currently attend Clarkson
        College to get my associates in PTA, thatâ€™s the entry level needed to enter into this field. I think I want to
        expand my knowledge with certificates after I graduate from Clarkson. In the past I earned my Certified Nursing
        Aid (CNA) certificate and worked as a CNA in nursing homes for 2 years. I'm very passionate about healthcare and
        would like to continue pursuing this career field.</p>

      <p> I currently work at Target, which turned out to be one of my
        favorite jobs. I get to see all of the new products, and I get to help people find products as I am an expert
        ðŸ˜‹. My favorite part about working is seeing the seasonal section, I especially love this around Christmas time,
        seeing the pretty lights! In the near future I have many personal goals I hope to achieve. I would like to
        settle down, start a family, be financially stable, and own a car and a house. My ideal house would be in a
        quiet neighborhood with 3 bedrooms and a beautiful view of the mountains. My dream car is a Subaru Outback to
        drive through those mountains and trenches. That means I need financial stability. Financial stability to me is
        having a solid savings account, personal investments, Roth IRA, and a good retirement plan. Ultimately,
        achieving these goals will bring me joy in my life because I strive to achieve something great.</p>
